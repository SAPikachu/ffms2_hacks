If you want to manually change what libraries FFmpegSource will be linked to,
here is the place to do it. auto_config.h is automatically generated by a .bat
file but may not always contain correct #defines.

If you want to force compilation WITH a given library, uncomment the corresponding #define.
If you want to force compilation WITHOUT a given library, uncomment the corresponding #undef.
